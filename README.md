# Cognizance Snap Syntax
Snap Syntax event at Cognizance


I have created the website exactly as shown in the video and have also added images in the correct order.

I have implemented the background change effect and created the star icon using only HTML and CSS.

For the entire project, I used only HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript for transitions. I did not use any design tools.

**Important:**
I have attached the video for reference. Since I used display-related measurements (`vh`, `%`, etc.), the website appears exactly as intended on my laptop screen (`1366 x 768` resolution). However, I am unsure how it appears on larger or smaller screens.

Please check the website using the provided link. You can inspect the page and set the screen size to `1366 x 768` to see my intended design.

I have also replicated the footer exactly as shown in the video, including the correct placement of the star when you scroll to the footer.
